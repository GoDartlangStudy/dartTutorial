  //In Dart, runes are the UTF-32 code points of a string.
  //
  //Unicode defines a unique numeric value for each letter, digit, and symbol used in all of the worldâ€™s writing systems. Because a Dart string is a sequence of UTF-16 code units, expressing 32-bit Unicode values within a string requires special syntax.
  //
  //The usual way to express a Unicode code point is \uXXXX, where XXXX is a 4-digit hexadecimal value. For example, the heart character (â™¥) is \u2665. To specify more or less than 4 hex digits, place the value in curly brackets. For example, the laughing emoji (ðŸ˜†) is \u{1f600}.
  //
  //The String class has several properties you can use to extract rune information. The codeUnitAt and codeUnit properties return 16-bit code units. Use the runes property to get the runes of a string.
  //
  //The following example illustrates the relationship between runes, 16-bit code units, and 32-bit code points. Click Run to see runes in action.
